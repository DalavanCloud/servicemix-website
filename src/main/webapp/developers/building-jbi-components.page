*Only project developers can commit to the SVN tree via this method. SSH must be installed on your client machine. Enter your site password when prompted.*

h2. Building the Source Code

h3. Maven configuratin
In order to successfully build the JBI components, you need to increase the amount of memory available during the build process.

On Linux/Unix/MacOS:
{noformat}
export MAVEN_OPTS="-XX:MaxPermSize=128m -Xmx1024m"
{noformat}

On Windows, you can use the command below or configure the environment variable in the Advanced Computer properties screen:
{noformat}
set MAVEN_OPTS="-XX:MaxPermSize=128m -Xmx1024m"
{noformat}

h3. Running the Maven build.
Afterwards, you can build the code with Maven.

{noformat}
mvn clean install
{noformat}

h2. Continuous integration
A CI build has been set up in Apache's [Hudson | http://hudson-ci.org/] instance at https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/ServiceMix-Components/
