The ServiceMix 4 NMR Project contains two building blocks for ServiceMix 4:
* NMR is a generic, lightweight OSGi messaging implementation, useful for e.g. interconnecting Camel routes across bundles
* a JBI 1.0 compatibility layer built on top of the NMR to allow ServiceMix 4 to support JBI components and deployables
