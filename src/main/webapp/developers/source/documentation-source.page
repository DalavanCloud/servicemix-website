h1. Documentation Project

The ServiceMix documentation project aims to build a set of manuals for ServiceMix using [Scalate|http://scalate.fusesource.org].

It's currently used to generate the contents for:
- ServiceMix 4.3-SNAPSHOT: [http://servicemix.apache.org/docs/4.3.0-SNAPSHOT/]

*Only project developers can commit to the SVN tree via this method. SSH must be installed on your client machine. Enter your site password when prompted.*

h2. Project layout
The project is a basic Maven WAR project.  Some important directories and files in the project:
* {{src/main/webapp}} : Contains the documentation page contents
* {{src/main/webapp/commands}} : TOC and index files for Console Commands manual section
* {{src/main/webapp/karaf}} : TOC and index files for Karaf manual section

h2. Building and deploying

h3. Prerequisites
Before being able to build and run this project, you need to download and install:
* [Pygments|http://pygments.org/] : http://pygments.org/download/
* [Prince XML|http://princexml.com] : http://princexml.com/download/

h3. Static website and WAR
The documentation website and WAR can be built by running *{{mvn clean install}}* on the documentation project.  This will create and install:
- {{target/sitegen}}: a local copy of the static website
- A WAR file for installing the documentation on an application server
- If [Prince XML|http://princexml.com] has been installed, it will also create the PDF manuals

h3. Live website for editing
Running *{{mvn jetty:run}}* in the documentation project allows you to preview the resulting website on http://localhost:8080.  Just edit any page and hit refresh in the browser to have a look at the result.

h3. Deploying a new documentation site copy
You can also deploy the site directly by running *{{mvn scalate:deploy}}* afterwards, provided you have set up the correct credentials for *{{people.apache.org}}* in *{{~/.m2/settings.xml}}*:
{pygmentize:lang=xml}
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0
                      http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>people.apache.org</id>
      <username>gertv</username>
      <!-- either one of these authentication methods -->
      <privateKey/>
      <password/>
    </server>
  </servers>

</settings>
{pygmentize}

h2. Hudson builds
A Hudson build has been set up for trunk in http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/ServiceMix-Docs/

{note:title=No automatic deployment}
At the moment, we're unable to deploy updates to the documentation automatically from the Hudson builds.
