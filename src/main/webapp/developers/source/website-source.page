h2. Building a new website

h3. A few words about the project structure

This project looks like a regular Maven war project.  The source for the website pages are living in the {{src/main/webapp}} directory.  We don't intend to release this project, the main goal is just to upload the result of the build to http://servicemix.apache.org/staging

h3. Build and browse locally

In the root of the website project, run a {{mvn clean install}} to create a new copy of the website.  You can find the generated website in the {{target/sitegen}} folder.
You can also run {{mvn jetty:run}} to have a live, browsable copy of the website available on your machine at http://localhost:8080 - this is very conventient for editing the website pages.

h3. Upload a new copy

If you're a committer, you can upload a new copy of the website into the staging area at http://servicemix.apache.org/staging by running a {{mvn scalate:deploy}}.

Before you run this command, ensure to configure the {{people.apache.org}} server credentials in your {{~/.m2/settings.xml}}.

{pygmentize:lang=xml}
<server>
  <id>people.apache.org</id>
  <username>your_apache_user_name</username>
  <password/> or <privateKey/>
</server>
