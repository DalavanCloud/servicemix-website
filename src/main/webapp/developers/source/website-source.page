h2. Building a new website

h3. A few words about the project structure
The project is a basic Maven WAR project.  Some important directories and files in the project:
* {{src/main/webapp}} : Contains the documentation page contents
* {{src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/scalate/layouts}} : Scalate SSP templates for the site

We don't intend to release this project, the main goal is just to upload the result of the build to http://servicemix.apache.org/staging

h3. Build and browse locally

In the root of the website project, run a {{mvn clean install}} to create a new copy of the website.  You can find the generated website in the {{target/sitegen}} folder.
You can also run {{mvn jetty:run}} to have a live, browsable copy of the website available on your machine at http://localhost:8080 - this is very conventient for editing the website pages.

h3. Upload a new copy

If you're a committer, you can upload a new copy of the website into the staging area at http://servicemix.apache.org/staging by running a {{mvn scalate:deploy}}.

Before you run this command, ensure to configure the {{people.apache.org}} server credentials in your {{~/.m2/settings.xml}}.
