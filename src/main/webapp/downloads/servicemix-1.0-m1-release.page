JBI services:
* WS-BPEL support via PXE (http://pxe.fivesight.com)

* timing & scheduler services using JCA and Quartz,
* validation through XSD/RelaxNG

ServiceMix has support for straight through processing, SEDA based process flows or fully clustered [process flows|http://servicemix.org/NMR+Flows].
