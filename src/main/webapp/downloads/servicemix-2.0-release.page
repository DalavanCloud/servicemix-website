We are pleased to announce the 2.0.2 release of ServiceMix!

h3. New and Noteworthy

* Improved JBI support including both interface based routing as well as service based routing together with improved WSDL parsing
* Support for [Publish Subscribe Routing]
* Improved [JAX WS] support 
* Migration to [XBean|http://xbean.org/] as the XML configuration mechanism which works with any Spring release and allows us to mix and match ServiceMix configuration with other XML configuration mechanisms like ActiveMQ and Jencks
* Migration to backport.util.concurrent to make it easier to move direct to a pure Java 5 solution.
* a new Loan Broker example from the [EIP Patterns Book|http://www.eaipatterns.com/ComposedMessagingWS.html]
* a new simpler POJO based deployment model
* build reorganised to make ServiceMix more modular
* a new ChainedComponent which implements simple pipelines of components easily

In addition a number of bug fixes and performance enhancements were made.
