This report for  December is the third  monthly 
report since ServiceMix graduation.

ServiceMix resources have been completely moved
out of the Incubator area.  We have reorganized
the svn subtree so that both ServiceMix 3.x and
4.x versions can coexist.

We  have released ServiceMix 3.2.1 on December 
the 2nd. Work is continuing on ServiceMix 4.0:
a  subproject  Apache  ServiceMix  Runtime has 
been  extracted  and  should be  released this 
month.

On  the  community  side,   Freeman  Fang  has 
accepted the prposed PMC membership (the  vote
was begin held at the time the  previous board
meeting  took  place).     Kristian's  account
has been created.
