Project Status
--------------
While we continue to have an active community with good participation from users on mailing lists, IRC, and issue reporting in Jira,
we also have lost some of our momentum now that major parts of the functionality are being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf and Apache Camel.

With the community objectives mentioned below, we want to ensure a new and better focus for the Apache ServiceMix project.

Community
---------
No changes since last report.

Community Objectives
--------------------
Our current objective is to work on a ServiceMix 4.5.0 release.
We keep on working on the documentation and website to ensure both new and existing users are finding their way around the project more easily.

Branding Status
---------------
- Project Naming And Descriptions : Compliant
- Website Navigation Links : Compliant
- Trademark Attributions : Non-compliant, will be compliant in new web site.
- Logos and Graphics : Current logo is not compliant, new logo will be compliant

Releases
