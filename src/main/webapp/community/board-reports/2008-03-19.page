Issues
======
 * we need to take care of the export policy,
   as some JBI components include libraries
   subject to such requirements
 * we have requested a solaris zone to root
 * discussions around importing a JBoss 
   plugin seem to have reached an agreement 
   that it should be doable
 * we have also raised some questions about
   repackaging some third party libraries 
   not under ASL 2.0 license to add OSGi 
   manifest entries and redistribute them
