This report for  October  is  the  first report 
since ServiceMix graduation last month.

ServiceMix  resources  have not been moved yet. 
Hopefully everything will be sorted out soon.

We  have  released  our  first  non  incubating 
version  of  ServiceMix,   the  3.1.2  version, 
on September 25th.  We are  currently preparing 
for our next big release, ServiceMix 3.2, which 
is planned for the end of October.  
Work has started on the next major  version 4.0
which will be based on OSGi.

On the community side,  both developer and user 
community are very active. A new committer  has 
been voted in.
