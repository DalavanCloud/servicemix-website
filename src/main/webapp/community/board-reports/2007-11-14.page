This report for  November is  the second report 
since ServiceMix graduation.

ServiceMix  resources  have not been completely
moved yet.  The web site has moved to its final
location (http://servicemix.apache.org) but the
mailing lists and svn have not been touched.

We  have  released ServiceMix 3.2 on November 
the 7th.  Work is continuing on ServiceMix 4.0
and we aim for a milestone release before the 
end of the year.

A new PMC member has just been voted in.
