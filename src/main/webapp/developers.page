This page contains a lot of useful information for people who want to learn more about the way Apache ServiceMix is being developed.

h2. Building Apache ServiceMix
Here are twe two main things you need to know before building Apache ServiceMix:
* [source] code locations
* [building] instructions

There's also a set of [coding standards] we follow to ensure that the codebase stays readable and maintainable.

Being an integration container project, we obviously have a lot of [related projects] both inside and outside of the ASF.

Once you become a committer, you might want to read this [guide|becoming-a-committer].

There's a handy [release guide] available to guide you through the process of preparing and releasing a new version of ServiceMix.

We also have a bit of background information on the [Apache Software Foundation].

h2. Tools
* information for [using Eclipse], incl. how to do [remote debugging|remote-debugging-servicemix-in-eclipse]
